Description: LEA is an R package dedicated to landscape genomics and
        ecological association tests. LEA can run analyses of
        population structure and genome scans for local adaptation. It
        includes statistical methods for estimating ancestry
        coefficients from large genotypic matrices and evaluating the
        number of ancestral populations (snmf, pca); and identifying
        genetic polymorphisms that exhibit high correlation with some
        environmental gradient or with the variables used as proxies
        for ecological pressures (lfmm), and controlling the false
        discovery rate. LEA is mainly based on optimized C programs
        that can scale with the dimension of very large data sets.
