Description: LEA is an R package dedicated to landscape genomics and
        ecological association tests. LEA can run analyses of
        population structure and genomewide tests for local adaptation. 
        The package includes statistical methods for estimating ancestry
        coefficients from large genotypic matrices and for evaluating the
        number of ancestral populations (snmf, pca). It performs statistical 
        tests using latent factor mixed models for identifying
        genetic polymorphisms that exhibit association with
        environmental gradients or phenotypic traits (lfmm). 
        LEA is mainly based on optimized C programs
        that can scale with the dimension of large data sets.
