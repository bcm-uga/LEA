Description: LEA is an R package dedicated to population genomics, landscape genomics and
        genotype-environment association tests. LEA can run analyses of
        population structure and genome-wide tests for local adaptation, 
        and also performs imputation of missing genotypes. 
        The package includes statistical methods for estimating ancestry
        coefficients from large genotypic matrices and for evaluating the
        number of ancestral populations (snmf). It performs statistical 
        tests using latent factor mixed models for identifying
        genetic polymorphisms that exhibit association with
        environmental gradients or phenotypic traits (lfmm2). 
        In addition, LEA computes values of genetic offset statistics based 
        on new or predicted environments (genetic.gap, genetic.offset). 
        LEA is mainly based on optimized programs
        that can scale with the dimensions of large data sets.
